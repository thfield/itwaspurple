animate delete button
"reverse" transition should shuffle entries
    see http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/index6.html
"edit" could flip the cards
lock down sizes to rems
make entry card uniform size
  edit mode and enter mode same size
  drag placeholder same size
add counter to 140 characters
tie scrolling to cards, fix controls and trashcan to page

###
### issues/bugs
###
edit with animation only works with addition of even number of new cards
edit with animation doesn't work when last card is removed
    if edit doesn't change mode, add a blank card and it should work
radio buttons don't animate correctly


### done
// add delete button to content areas  
// tweet functionality? edit: too much hassle to get working
// switch to border box sizing
// add new entry button at bottom of card stack
// about section: examples, inspiration
