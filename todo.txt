### to do
save/load to local filesystem
  read/write as json?
  //add delete button to content areas    
improve website 
  prettify style
  about section: examples, inspiration
  // tweet functionality? edit: too much hassle to get working
improve ui    
  "reverse" transition should shuffle entries
  "edit" could flip the cards
switch to border box sizing
make entry card uniform size
  edit mode and enter mode same size
  drag placeholder same size
controls
  add new entry button at bottom of card stack



### issues 
animation breaks functionality 
  dragging to trash breaks reverse animation but not edit
  adding entry breaks animation
  culprit:
    jquery callback after ajax request/dom update
