"reverse" transition should shuffle entries
    see http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/index6.html
"edit" could flip the cards
lock down sizes to rems
make entry card uniform size
  edit mode and enter mode same size
  drag placeholder same size
add counter to 140 characters
tie scrolling to cards, fix controls and trashcan to page
move delete all outside of trashcan
change header html to reference single file
