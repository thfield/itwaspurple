### to do
save/load to local filesystem
  read/write as json?
save should make trashbin items separate
//add delete button to content areas    
improve website 
  prettify style
  about section: examples, inspiration
  // tweet functionality? edit: too much hassle to get working
  svg sprite for buttons
improve ui
  animate delete button
  "reverse" transition should shuffle entries
    see http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/index6.html
  "edit" could flip the cards
switch to border box sizing
make entry card uniform size
  edit mode and enter mode same size
  drag placeholder same size
controls
  add new entry button at bottom of card stack
add counter to 140 characters
change sprite sheet to individual images, use compass sheets

lock down sizes to rems

### issues 
//animation breaks functionality 
  dragging to trash breaks reverse animation but not edit
  adding entry breaks animation
  probable culprit:
    jquery callback after ajax request/dom update

edit with animation only works with addition of even number of new portlets
edit with animation doesn't work when last portlet is removed
